# classical
The application scrapes info about classical music events from multiple venues in Helsnki and St.Petersburg, stores the data and displays to a user providing several handy filtering options.
* Wikipedia API is used to fetch related information about composers and/or opuses.
* YouTube videos of opuses are searched where possible and embedded in the web-app.

This is a back-end part of the application.
See https://github.com/AleksTeresh/classical-scrape for the python scraping scripts and https://github.com/AleksTeresh/classical-front for the front-end.
